# Simple Example

In this example, both the Prim+RPC client and server are used in the
[same file](./index.js) to communicate with [our JavaScript module](./hello.js).
Most of the time, Prim+RPC is used to access code where it's not immediately
available (like between a web browser and web server). For demonstration, we'll
set up both in the same file. We'll separate this into two sections: client and
server.

To start this example, run:

```zsh
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
