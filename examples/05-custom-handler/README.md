# Custom JSON Handler Example

In this example, a web server and web browser are bridged with Prim+RPC. This is
very similar to the [Client / Server Example](../02-client-server) except that
this example uses YAML in place of the default JSON handler. This examples also
uses Express in place of Fastify as a server framework.

You can start both the server and client, at the same time, by running the
"start" helper script:

```zsh
pnpm start
```
