# File Upload

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz_small.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/file-upload)

In this example, a file is uploaded to a web server using Prim+RPC. This is set
up in a similar fashion to the [Client / Server Example](../client-server) but
instead demonstrates the ability to upload a file by simply passing it to the
function without the extra processing client or server side.

You can start both the server and client, at the same time, by running the
"start" helper script:

```zsh
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
